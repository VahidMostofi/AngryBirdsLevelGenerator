# AngryBirdsLevelGenerator
In Fall 2017 I was trying to generate levels for a game like angry birds automatically for a side project. The project canceled and I stopped in the middle. A few days ago I found the code and decided to publish the results as is for fun.

The structures are generated randomly, but it's possible to control the height of the structure, as you can see in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quql0uDRRkE), not all of them are stable though.
